# Discord Bartender
This is a simple Discord bot that I created on a [Youtube stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7mgd1G0ZWI) for one of my viewers. To request your own program to be made on stream, join my Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/kzAtEH6), and send a message in the #video-requests channel.

# Setup
To set this bot up for yourself, follow these steps:
 1. Download this project.
 1. Install Python (I used 3.8.2) `MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE PIP TOOL INSTALLED AND ADD PYTHON TO PATH (environment variables)`
 1. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder.
 1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 1. Create an environment variable called `BartenderToken` and set it to your bot's token.
 1. Change line `10` in `main.py` to have your log channel id.
 1. Run `python main.py`.
